C++ What are Classes and Objects?

Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and functions from the class.

You will learn much more about classes and objects in the next chapter.
